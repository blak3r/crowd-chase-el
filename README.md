## Crowd Chase EL

Is a simple EL wire controller to be used by a group of people wearing EL Wires.
Each person sets which number they are in a sequence by pressing a push button.
Then, the controller will turn on their EL wire when it's their turn in the sequence.

The circuit uses a basic 8 bit PIC microcontroller (sorry arduino peeps)...

The board design uses all through hole components to make it easy for novices to solder.

### BOM Cost ###
Approximately $10
